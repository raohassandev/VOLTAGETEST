## Summary

All code-fixable P0 and P1 blockers identified in the audit report `UMS_Final_Repo_Test_Audit_After_f23da25.md` have been resolved. Docker certification passes all 13 steps. Playwright test suite passes 93/93. One hardware item (P0-9) requires on-site sign-off and is documented below.

---

## P0 Blockers â€” Status

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| P0-1 | `volt_dc` double-calibration in `/api/ups/[id]/route.ts` | âœ… Fixed â€” server now passes volt_dc through directly; firmware v1.0.0 publishes pre-calibrated volts |
| P0-2 | Firmware HTML stray `'>` fragments in WiFi/MQTT password fields | âœ… Fixed â€” merged `page +=` strings correctly in `firmware/VOLTAGETEST/VOLTAGETEST.ino` |
| P0-3 | Stale docs referencing legacy MQTT topic, firmware path, wrong port | âœ… Fixed â€” updated `COMMISSIONING_GUIDE.md`, `CREDENTIALS.md`, `web-dashboard/README.md`, `firmware/README.md`, `release/UMS_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`, `docs/ESP32_SITE_WORK_PLAN.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`, `mosquitto/passwords.example`; 5 legacy planning docs and old screenshots archived |
| P0-4 | `telemetry-types.ts` comments referenced removed server-side calibration fields | âœ… Fixed â€” deprecated `volt_dc_raw` and `volt_dc_calibration_source` with explanatory comments |
| P0-5 | `telemetry-worker.ts` header listed wrong payload field names | âœ… Fixed â€” header updated to v1.0.0 field list with dual-worker note |
| P0-6 | `certify.sh` had hardcoded `AdminTest123!` default password | âœ… Fixed â€” script now requires `CERT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var; fails fast if unset |
| P0-7 | `.env.example` exposed `AdminTest123!` placeholder | âœ… Fixed â€” replaced with commented placeholder `# CERT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-this-to-your-actual-admin-password` |
| P0-8 | No current UI screenshots in repo | âœ… Fixed â€” 19 screenshots (13 desktop 1440Ã—900 + 6 mobile 390Ã—844) committed to `docs/audit/screenshots/2026-05-24/`; old screenshots archived to `archive/Screenshots-legacy/` |
| P0-9 | Live board proof at `192.168.0.100` | â³ Pending on-site â€” device unreachable from development machine; requires on-site engineer to verify `/api/info`, `/data`, `mqtt_auth=true`, and dashboard Online status |
| P0-10 | Docker certification script failures (DROP DATABASE transaction error, missing `.dockerignore`) | âœ… Fixed â€” `certify.sh` step 13 DROP/CREATE split into separate `exec` calls; `.dockerignore` added to `web-dashboard/` |

---

## P1 Blockers â€” Status

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| P1-1 | Test device DB cleanup â€” `DEV-COM11-TEST` (8,693 rows) and `SMOKE-TEST-001` present in production DB | âœ… Done â€” both devices deleted after dry-run review; `UMS-3076F5A5AD54` (real hardware) untouched |
| P1-2 | `audit-screenshots.ts` referenced stale device IDs `UPSMON-01`, `UPS-COM11-TEST` | âœ… Fixed â€” updated to `UPS-OFFLINE-TEST` and `UMS-3076F5A5AD54` |
| P1-3 | `telemetry.ts` demo fallback used `UPSMON-001` | âœ… Fixed â€” changed to `UMS-DEMO-001` with explanatory comment |
| P1-4 | No documented security audit of npm dependencies | âœ… Fixed â€” `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md` created with full `npm audit --omit=dev` output and risk decisions |

## Verification Results

### Playwright Test Suite
```
93 passed (93/93)
```
All UI, API, auth, alarm, and telemetry tests pass.

### Docker Certification (`certify.sh`)
```
ALL CERTIFICATION STEPS PASSED
```
Steps verified:
1. Repo state
2. Prerequisites (.env + mosquitto/passwords)
3. Fresh stack (compose up --build)
4. All 4 containers running (postgres, mosquitto, web, mqtt-worker)
5. DB migrations (init, v2_fields, energy_fields)
6. `/api/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}` with no internal fields exposed
7. Auth flow (redirect, login, cookie, session)
8. External MQTT smoke test (device payload published)
9. DB telemetry verification (TelemetryRaw + TelemetryLatest rows confirmed)
10. `/api/telemetry/latest` shows smoke device
11. Manual `POST /api/telemetry/latest` blocked with 403
12. UPS PATCH creates AuditLog row
13. Backup (pg_dump) and restore to test DB verified

### Build & Lint
```
TypeScript: 0 errors
ESLint:     0 errors
Next.js build: âœ“ Compiled successfully
```

## Known Deferred Items (Safe to Ship)

| Item | Reason deferred |
|------|----------------|
| `postcss` moderate CVE | Fix requires `next@9.3.3` (breaking change); build-time only, not exploitable at runtime |
| `uuid`/`hyperid`/`aedes` moderate CVEs | Only active when `ENABLE_EMBEDDED_BROKER=true`; production Docker deployment uses external Mosquitto; deferred until aedes@0.44.0 is stable |

Full details in `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md`.

## Commits Applied Since Audit

| Commit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `f23da25` | fix: resolve all P0 release blockers â€” volt_dc, firmware password, docs, certify |
| `11d7b71` | fix: address all remaining audit blockers â€” volt_dc UPS detail, firmware HTML, docs, screenshots, certify |
| `ef97287` | fix: add Telemetry1m delete to cleanup script (FK constraint) |

## Remaining Gate

**P0-9 â€” Live Board Proof** is the sole remaining release gate. All code and infrastructure items are closed. Once an on-site engineer confirms:

1. `curl http://192.168.0.100/api/info` â†’ returns device info with `mqtt_auth: true`
2. `curl http://192.168.0.100/data` â†’ returns live telemetry JSON
3. Dashboard shows the device as **Online**
4. LAN Scan discovers the board

â€¦the release may be tagged `v1.0.0` and merged to `master`.
